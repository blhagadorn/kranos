# Kranos
Kranos is a WASM filter for Envoy intended to add header security inspired by [HelmetJS](https://helmetjs.github.io/) when serving content to the browser with response headers.  

For more information on security headers see [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project)
